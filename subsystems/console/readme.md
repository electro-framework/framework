# Task Runner

##### Selenia framework's command-line interface

A command-line interface to Selenia.

Allows one to run automation scripts the perform repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc.

It can also assist the developer during the development process by:

* Scaffolding Modules, Controllers, Views and many other framework-related constructs.
* Installing / removing plugin modules.

## Installation

This package comes pre-installed as an integrant part of the framework, so you usually don't need to install this manually.
