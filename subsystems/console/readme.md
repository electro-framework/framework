# Console Application

##### Selenia framework's command-line interface

## Introduction

This package allows you to create console (command-line-based) applications with the Selenia framework.

## Installation

This package comes pre-installed as an integrant part of the framework, so you usually don't need to install this manually.

If you are not using the standard `framework` package, type this on the terminal:

```shell
composer require selenia-components/task-runner
```
