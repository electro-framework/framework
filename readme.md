# Framework

The Electro framework's standard installation profile

## Standard framework installation

By requiring this package on your project's `composer.json` file, you will install the framework with all recommended packages for a standard configuration.

> Some optional parts of the framework are available elsewere as plugin packages that you can install on demand. Refer to the framework's documentation for instructions on how to install plugins.

You should not install this package on an empty project, as it doesn't provide the underlying files and directory structure required by a fully-working application.

Use the [Electro base installation](https://github.com/electro-framework/electro) as your application's starting point.

## Customized framework installation

In a near future, there will be more framework installation profiles available.

Alternative installation profiles will provide customized versions of the framework that may be more suitable for some scenarios. For instance, a "micro-framework" profile would install a minimum set of subsystems, with a narrower scope and tuned for maximum performance.

For now, this package is the only profile available, which consists of a set of subsystems that forn a generic web framework, suitable for most common usage scenarios.

When alternative profiles became available, you'll be able to find them on GitHub, on the `electro-framework` organization.
